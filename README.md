1.	**Overview and Purpose of the system/Product**.
      
      **Overview - Certificate Management System.**<br/>
	     It is the use of digital certificates to represent user and device identity as well as to authenticate new devices such as medical equipment, intelligence sensors and other internet connected systems. It was created to address challenges that arise in the issuance, verification and overall management of certificates in PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). CMS has since replaced the conventional internal mechanism like directory entries.<br/>  
		**Purpose:**<br/>
(i)	CMS provides framework for controlling issuance and management of certificates within PKI across various  devices.<br/>
(ii) CMS provides device key generation and support for wide array platform combined with in depth reporting and loading infrastructure.<br/>
(iii)	CMS makes the expansion of connected enterprise secure and manageable task.<br/>
(iv)	CMS brings IT administrators everything they need to manage PKI at scale reducing risk of service outages or downtime due to expired certificates or configuration issues.

2.	**System Content / System Boundaries.**<br/>

  (i)	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) : Refers to the framework used to protect communication between your website and users. It is also the backbone of scalable   secure communication and authentication.<br/>

3.	**Interaction (Potential) of the product (with other products and components).**<br/>
Integration with MDN (Mozilla Developer Network â€“web platform including html, css, javascript) systems.<br/>

4.	**Product Features (short description)**.<br/>
	
(i)	**Reporting and Admin module.**<br/>
  -This was designed to scan, track and provide oversight of every certificate in the infrastructure.<br/>
  -It automates certificate management thereby eliminating manual tracking methods.<br/>
  -Allows CMS to view and provide oversight of any PKI certificate regardless of its type.<br/>

(ii)	**Mobile Issuance module.**<br/>
  -Allows for digital certificate issuance to wider way of both traditional and mobile forms.<br/>
  -Allows for secure and scalable certificate issuance.<br/>

5.**Security requirements.**<br/>
  -Authentication e .g user membership account.<br/>

6.**Characteristics  of users	 (who is the end user of the systems)**<br/>

(i)	IT security architects.<br/>
(ii)	IT administrators.<br/>
(iii)	Other customers.<br/>

7.**Restrictions:**<br/>

(i)Manages only a subset of all certificates.<br/>
(ii) Does not issue or revoke any certificate.
